# Gale-Shapley
This algorithm was implemented to address the stable marriage problem.
#
Given: We are given two sets of elements of the same size and a list ordering the preference for each element.
#
Objective: Find a stable match! This means there is an element A that prefers some element B over the element A is already matched to. B also prefers A over its current matching element.
#
Context: In this example, we're playing cupid by creating a stable match for single men and women. Their preferences can be found in the following text files (ten, hundred, thousand). Each line begins with the name of the person, then every other name refers to their ranking.
